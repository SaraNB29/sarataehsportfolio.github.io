    My Portfolio
    My name is Sara Nathu-Bobb and I am a Web and App developer at Thomas A. Edison CTE High School. I love to work with people around me concerning anything. Something I wish to achieve is to
    collaberate with my peers on web design projects. I can be reached at snat6272@taehs.org</p>
